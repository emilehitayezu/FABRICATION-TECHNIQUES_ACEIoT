# Day 5 – Digital Fabrication I: CNC & Laser Cutting

## CNC Machining Principles

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a **subtractive manufacturing process** where material is removed from a solid workpiece using computer-controlled cutting tools. The machine follows precise toolpaths generated from digital designs, allowing for high accuracy, repeatability, and complex geometries.

## Laser Cutting Workflows and Constraints

Laser cutting uses a **focused laser beam** to cut or engrave materials. The workflow typically includes design creation, file preparation, machine parameter setup, and cutting.

Key constraints include:
- Material thickness limits
- Kerf width caused by the laser beam
- Heat-affected zones
- Material compatibility (e.g., some plastics release toxic fumes)

## Toolpaths, Kerf, Feeds, and Speeds

- **Toolpaths** define the movement of the cutting tool or laser.
- **Kerf** is the width of material removed during cutting.

- **Feeds** refer to the speed at which the tool moves through the material.

- **Speeds** refer to spindle speed (CNC) or laser power and cutting speed (laser cutting).


Correct selection of these parameters ensures clean cuts, accuracy, and tool longevity.

## 2D and 2.5D Fabrication Strategies

- **2D fabrication** involves cutting flat shapes from sheet material (e.g., laser-cut panels).

- **2.5D fabrication** includes multiple cutting depths but no fully free-form 3D shapes (e.g., pockets, slots, and contours in CNC milling).

These strategies are commonly used for enclosures, furniture, and structural components.

## File Preparation for CNC and Laser Machines

Files must be prepared correctly to ensure successful fabrication:

- Vector formats (SVG, DXF) for laser cutting

- CAM-generated toolpaths (G-code) for CNC machining

- Correct scaling and units

- Clean geometry with no open paths or overlaps


Proper file preparation reduces errors and machine downtime.

## Assembly Methods for Flat-Fabricated Parts

Common assembly methods include:
- Press-fit joints

- Slots and tabs

- Screws and bolts

- Adhesives

Designing parts with assembly in mind improves structural strength and ease of construction.
