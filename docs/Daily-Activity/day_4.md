## Material Properties and Selection Strategies

Material selection depends on the **intended function, manufacturing process, cost, and environment**. Key material properties considered include strength, stiffness, weight, thermal resistance, electrical properties, and ease of fabrication. A good selection strategy balances **performance requirements** with **manufacturing constraints** and **availability**.

## Wood, Plastics, Metals, and Composites

- **Wood**: Easy to machine, low cost, renewable, commonly used in furniture and structural prototypes.

- **Plastics**: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, electrically insulating, widely used in 3D printing and injection molding.

- **Metals**: Strong, durable, electrically and thermally conductive, suitable for mechanical and electronic applications.

- **Composites**: Combine multiple materials to achieve improved strength-to-weight ratio, used in advanced structural applications.

## Subtractive vs Additive Fabrication Methods

- **Subtractive fabrication** removes material from a solid block (e.g., CNC milling, laser cutting).

- **Additive fabrication** builds objects layer by layer (e.g., 3D printing).


Subtractive methods offer high precision and surface quality, while additive methods allow complex geometries and reduced material waste.

## Material Behavior During Fabrication

Materials respond differently during fabrication processes:
- Wood may warp or burn

- Plastics may melt or deform under heat

- Metals may generate burrs or require cooling


Understanding material behavior helps in choosing correct 

**tools, speeds, and fabrication parameters**.

## Sustainability and Material Efficiency

Sustainable material use focuses on:
- Reducing waste

- Using recyclable or renewable materials

- Optimizing designs for minimal material usage


Efficient material selection reduces environmental impact and improves long-term sustainability.

---

## Cost, Durability, and Lifecycle Considerations

- **Cost** includes raw material, fabrication, and maintenance expenses

- **Durability** determines how long a material performs its function

- **Lifecycle considerations** evaluate environmental impact from production to disposal


Selecting materials with a favorable lifecycle improves both economic and environmental outcomes.
